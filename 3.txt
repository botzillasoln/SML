The Pearson correlation test evaluates the strength and direction of the linear relationship between two variables. In this analysis, the Pearson correlation coefficient (𝑟) quantifies the degree of association, ranging from -1 (perfect negative correlation) to 1 (perfect positive correlation), with 0 indicating no linear relationship. The accompanying p-value assesses the statistical significance of the correlation. If the p-value is below the chosen significance level (commonly 0.05), the correlation is deemed statistically significant, suggesting a meaningful linear association between the variables. Graphical visualization, such as a scatter plot with a fitted regression line, further aids interpretation by illustrating the trend and dispersion of data points. Together, these results provide a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the two variables under study.
