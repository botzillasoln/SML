This program demonstrates several ways to generate samples using sampling functions in R. You can perform simple random sampling (with or without replacement), generate random numbers from various distributions such as the normal and uniform distributions, and generate random integers within a specified range. Sampling is a fundamental operation in statistics and is widely used for simulations, Monte Carlo methods, and resampling techniques like bootstrapping.
